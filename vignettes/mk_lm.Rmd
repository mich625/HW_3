###____________above is what was creaded by usethis, may need to edit____________________________

To use the function mk_lm an output Y must be included

```{r}
mk_lm(Y = mtcars$mpg, X = cbind(mtcars$wt, mtcars$cyl), X_names = c("weight", "cylinders"))
```




This function can also do simple linear regression

```{r}
mk_lm(Y = mtcars$mpg, X = matrix(mtcars$wt, ncol = 1), X_names = c("weight"))
```



To show an example from another r base dataset
```{r}

```



This function creates an identical output to the well established lm() function as shown below to
5 decimal spaces.
