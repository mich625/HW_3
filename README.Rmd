# hw3mklinreg  

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of hw3mklinreg is to run a linear regression comparrable to what is found with the lm() function.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hw3mklinreg from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mich625/HW_3")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to run a regression using this package with the r base mtcars dataset. It will use mpg as the outcome based on the covariates for cylinders and weight:

```{r example}
library(hw3mklinreg)
mk_lm(Y = mtcars$mpg, X = cbind(mtcars$wt, mtcars$cyl), X_names = c("weight", "cylinders"))
```
